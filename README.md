# Cholesterol Distribution Analysis
The project analyzes the distribution of total cholesterol levels for males aged 40 to 60 in the United States using NHANES 2021–2022 raw survey data.
It generates the following output:
1. A distribution CSV (cholesterol_distribution.csv)
2. A Python plot showing cholesterol (mg/dL) vs. percentage of population
3. An arrow marker at cholesterol = 184 mg/dL
   
The goal is to provide a transparent and reproducible workflow using official U.S. public health survey data.
